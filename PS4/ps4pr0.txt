PS 4: Problem 0
Put your response to the reading below.


Ray Kurzweil indeed shows a positive attitude toward robots because he seems always to believe that high technology could replace people's null work, make people to live longer, and etc. I am shocked when reading his overly optimistic. I do think there will be many conflicts between humans and robots, which needs time to find answers. 
Also, his predictions about the future are very accurate. I believe what the author writes because all predictions actually become true. Even though some of them might not be totally actualized, they are still on the way to success.
